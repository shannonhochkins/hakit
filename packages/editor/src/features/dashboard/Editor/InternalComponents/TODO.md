Popup = Uses Fab button from editor - this is wrong, it should have a standalone button for the dashboard to control theming and style independently of the editor FABs.
Popup - Swap out global css variables for theme variables
Theme controls - Need the ability to have re-usable theme css variables for the entire dashboard
