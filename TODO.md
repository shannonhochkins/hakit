- Swap out kinde for clerke?
- Now need to focus on the "Theme" part, where you can "install" themes, which will create a new config and related rows in the db, and also with preset values
- Need to figure out UX from login -> editor
  - We can have multiple "dashboards", each with their own global config, individual pages
  - Need to figure out how the navigation for this data type will work
  - Once loading the editor with a "dashboard" id /editor/1, it could show a dropdown menu with the "Dashboard", and another with the "pageConfigurations"
